# product-list-app

A simple full-stack application presenting a list of products with the possibility of data manipulation.

## How to run?

A docker-compose.yml file was created for the project, which allows you to build a simple architecture locally using Docker.

Simply:

```sh
./start-infrastructure.sh
```

After that, after initialization, the front-end application should be served at localhost, on 3001 port.

[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
